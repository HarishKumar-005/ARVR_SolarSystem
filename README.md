Solar System with ARVR

This project is an immersive AR/VR experience that lets you explore the solar system in 3D. It combines interactive models, real-time annotations, and both augmented and virtual reality to create a unique learning experience about space.

Hackathon Experience"

I built this project as part of Hack Forge 1.0, a national-level hackathon, with my team LEAPING MIND. This event was a fantastic opportunity to explore innovative AR/VR solutions for education.

Features:

3D Planet Models: Interactive models of planets and celestial bodies.

Dual AR/VR Modes: Enjoy both augmented reality on mobile devices and full virtual reality immersion.

Interactive Learning: Real-time facts and annotations make learning engaging and accessible.

APK File for Testing

The AppApkFile folder contains the APK file for testing.

Instructions:

1. Install the APK on your Android device.


2. Open the app and tap on the visual marker to place the solar system in your environment.

This is just a demo model showcasing the potential of immersive learning with AR/VR. With further development, this technology can revolutionize education by making complex concepts more interactive, engaging, and accessible. I truly believe AR/VR has the power to transform the way we learn, and I’m excited about its possibilities. Thank you for reviewing my project—I would love to hear your feedback!
