ARVR_SolarSystem
An Immersive AR/VR Solar System Experience

About the Project
Our team, LEAPING MIND, built this project as part of Hack Forge 1.0 (Team ID: TEM8283), a national-level hackathon. This was an exciting opportunity for us to explore AR/VR solutions in education, and we developed an interactive solar system experience that brings learning to life!

Features
🚀 3D Planet Models – Interactive and detailed models of planets and celestial bodies.
🔄 Dual AR/VR Modes – Experience augmented reality (AR) on mobile devices and full virtual reality (VR) immersion.
📚 Interactive Learning – Real-time facts and annotations enhance engagement and accessibility.

APK File for Testing
The AppApkFile folder contains the APK file for testing.

Instructions:
1️⃣ Install the APK on your Android device.
2️⃣ Open the app and tap on the visual marker to place the solar system in your environment.

This is just a demo model showcasing the potential of immersive learning with AR/VR. With further development, this technology can revolutionize education by making complex concepts more interactive, engaging, and accessible.

As a team, we truly believe AR/VR has the power to transform the way we learn, and we’re excited about its possibilities. Thank you for reviewing our project—we would love to hear your feedback! 🚀🌍✨
